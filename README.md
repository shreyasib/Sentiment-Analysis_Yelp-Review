## YELP

Yelp is a popular review platform that allows customers to provide feedback on businesses such as restaurants, cafes, and shops. The platform has over 200 million reviews and is a valuable source of information for customers and business owners. To analyze and understand the opinion expressed in these reviews, we use Sentiment analysis to identify and extract the sentiment expressed in textual data. 



The sentiment analysis of Yelp reviews involves two broad steps: Text preprocessing and multiclass classification.
